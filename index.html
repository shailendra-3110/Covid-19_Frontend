              Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.<br>

              Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. <br><br>
              Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. <br><br>

              The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. <br>
              Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. <br><br>

              The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette.
                  
        </p>
        <p> Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste. Symptoms may begin one to     fourteen days after exposure to the virus. At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms. <br>
            Of those people who develop noticeable symptoms enough to be classed as patients, most (81%) develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging), and 5% suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction).Older people are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms. <br><br>
            Some people continue to experience a range of effects (long COVID) for months after recovery, and damage to organs has been observed. Multi-year studies are currently underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease. <br><br>
